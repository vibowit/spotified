Spotify Connect for raspberry with archlinux

All credits to: 
- [plietar](https://github.com/plietar/) for [librespot](https://github.com/plietar/librespot) and its [continuation](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot)
- David Cooper for [raspotify](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify)

I shamelesly copied the idea from raspotify, and modified it slightly so it could be installed on archlinux version of Raspberry.
I had some problems with binaries from raspotify, so I did my own cross compilation of librespot.
